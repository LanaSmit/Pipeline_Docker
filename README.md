# Pipeline_Docker
A containerized data pipeline built with Docker Desktop, PostgreSQL, and WSL2 (Ubuntu for Windows).
It extracts data from CSV files and loads it into a PostgreSQL database using Python scripts.
All sensitive or personal configuration details are managed securely through a .env file (excluded from version control).
The setup uses Docker Compose for container management and runs smoothly on Windows via WSL2 integration.
