# Pipeline_Docker
A containerized data pipeline built with Docker Desktop, PostgreSQL, and WSL2 (Ubuntu for Windows).
It extracts data from CSV files and loads it into a PostgreSQL database using Python scripts.
The setup uses Docker Compose for container management and demonstrates Linux-based data workflows running on Windows through WSL2 integration.
